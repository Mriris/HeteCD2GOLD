  abstract = {A reliable yet inexpensive tool for the estimation of flood water spread is conducive for efficient disaster management. The application of optical and SAR imagery in tandem provides a means of extended availability and enhanced reliability of flood mapping. We propose a methodology to merge these two types of imagery into a common data space and demonstrate its use in the identification of affected populations and infrastructure for the 2022 floods in Pakistan. The merging of optical and SAR data provides us with improved observations in cloud-prone regions; that is then used to gain additional insights into flood mapping applications. The use of open source datasets from WorldPop and OSM for population and roads respectively makes the exercise globally replicable. The integration of flood maps with spatial data on population and infrastructure facilitates informed policy design. We have shown that within the top five flood-affected districts in Sindh province, Pakistan, the affected population accounts for 31 \%, while the length of affected roads measures 1410.25 km out of a total of 7537.96 km.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of remote sensing technologies, change detection in heterogeneous images becomes much more necessary and significant. The main difficulty lies in how to make input heterogeneous images comparable so that the changes can be detected. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end heterogeneous change detection method based on the feature space constraint. First, considering that the input heterogeneous images are in two distinct feature spaces, two encoders with the same structure are used to extract features, respectively. A decoder is used to obtain the change map from the extracted features. Then, the Gram matrices, which include the correlations between features, are calculated to represent different feature spaces, respectively. The squared Euclidean distance between Gram matrices, termed as feature space loss, is used to constrain the extracted features. After that, a combined loss function consisting of the binary cross entropy loss and feature space loss is designed for training the model. Finally, the change detection results between heterogeneous images can be obtained when the model is trained well. The proposed method can constrain the features of two heterogeneous images to the same feature space while keeping their unique features so that the comparability between features can be enhanced and better detection results can be achieved. Experiments on two heterogeneous image datasets consisting of optical and SAR images demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

Most notably, we propose two Siamese extensions of fully convolutional networks which use heuristics about the current problem to achieve the best results in our tests on two open change detection datasets, using both RGB and multispectral images. We show that our system is able to learn from scratch using annotated change detection images. Our architectures achieve better performance than previously proposed methods, while being at least 500 times faster than related systems. This work is a step towards efficient processing of data from large scale Earth observation systems such as Copernicus or Landsat.},

ABSTRACT = {Change detection (CD) is essential to the accurate understanding of land surface changes using available Earth observation data. Due to the great advantages in deep feature representation and nonlinear problem modeling, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular to solve CD tasks in remote-sensing community. However, most existing deep learning-based CD methods are implemented by either generating difference images using deep features or learning change relations between pixel patches, which leads to error accumulation problems since many intermediate processing steps are needed to obtain final change maps. To address the above-mentioned issues, a novel end-to-end CD method is proposed based on an effective encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation named UNet++, where change maps could be learned from scratch using available annotated datasets. Firstly, co-registered image pairs are concatenated as an input for the improved UNet++ network, where both global and fine-grained information can be utilized to generate feature maps with high spatial accuracy. Then, the fusion strategy of multiple side outputs is adopted to combine change maps from different semantic levels, thereby generating a final change map with high accuracy. The effectiveness and reliability of our proposed CD method are verified on very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite image datasets. Extensive experimental results have shown that our proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art CD methods.},

  abstract = {Earth observation (EO) satellites facilitate hazard monitoring and mapping over large-scale and remote areas. Despite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites being well-documented as a hazard monitoring tool, the uptake of these data is geographically variable, with the Australian continent being one example where the use of SAR data is limited. Consequently, less is known about how these data apply in the Australian context, how they could aid national hazard monitoring and assessment, and what new insights could be gleaned for the benefit of the international disaster risk reduction community. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellite mission now provides the first spatially and temporally complete global SAR dataset and the first opportunity to use these data to systematically assess hazards in new locations. Using the example of Australia, where floods and uncontrolled bushfires, earthquakes, resource extraction (groundwater, mining, hydrocarbons) and geomorphological changes each pose potential risks to communities, we review past usage of EO for hazard monitoring and present a suite of new case studies that demonstrate the potential added benefits of SAR. The outcomes provide a baseline understanding of the potential role of SAR in national hazard monitoring and assessment in an Australian context. Future opportunities to improve national hazard identification will arise from: new SAR sensing capabilities, which for Australia includes a first-ever civilian EO capability, NovaSAR-1; the integration of Sentinel-1 SAR with other EO datasets; and the provision of standardised SAR products via Analysis Ready Data and Open Data Cubes to support operational applications.},
